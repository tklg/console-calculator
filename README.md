console-calculator
==================

I used node.js as my calculator because it was easier than calc.exe.

But, it wasnt pretty enough.

So, I took a [javascript console application](https://github.com/openexchangerates/javascript-sandbox-console) and stuck a [graphing site](graph.tk) onto it.

Now I have a pretty calculator! :D
